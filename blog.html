  Avoiding The Monotony of Life

  One day when I was about 10 years old, I approached my mom. Like most mothers, she knew something was wrong. I had a scowl on my face, and I can still remember how the conversation went.

  Me : “Mom?”
  
  Mom: “What is it”?”

  Me: “I’m tired of going to school and doing the same thing every day.”

  The conversation eventually tailed off with her signature gentle dismissal. It was an attitude towards the world that I had become accustomed to. “That’s life, it’s how many people in the world choose to live”, she said before she walked away. That sentence stuck with me for years; it was with me through high-school, and college.

  As you might have guessed, I’ve never had an appreciation for a boring lifestyle. And yet, most of us, myself included, fall into the trap of doing the same thing, day in, and day out. On the weekdays we go to school or work, and on the weekends, we drink to “let loose”. In other words, we drink to avoid doing work all week; to avoid a seemingly monotonous lifestyle, while unwittingly creating the cycle of working and drinking. How ironic.

  The dissonance of disliking monotony, and living a lifestyle that encourages it, is something that I often find myself struggling with. It’s something that is hard to break out of, not because it is a cycle that I have consciously chosen to participate in, but because my environment pushes me in that direction. Think about it. High-school has pushed me to go to college, and I can’t succeed in college without studying for hours on end. When I’m done studying for hours on end, I end up relieving stress with some vice: likely alcohol, weed, video-games - you get the idea. This is all made worse by the fact that everybody else in society goes through the same shit that you do, which results in all of us wanting to indulge in the same vices together; pushing us further toward living boring lifestyles.

  There’s nothing seriously wrong with any of those things every once in a while, but once they’re done regularly, they contribute to a monotonous lifestyle. And let me tell you, it’s fucking depressing.

  There’s a reason for why people come back from vacations overseas feeling refreshed and bubbly: they broke out of their default settings.

  In 2005, David Foster Wallace gave a commencement speech to Kenyon College. In it, he talked about the need to break out of our default settings; the need to avoid going through life unconscious; empirically alone; monotonous. At the time I listened to the speech, it resonated with me in ways that I didn’t expect it to. Going through life unconscious has been one of my biggest fears, and yet I’m afraid that I may have already been unconscious for most of my life. My only hope is that I can move forward by participating in more activities that don’t involve drinking, or playing video-games.

  In a few words, I think the takeaway is that pushing myself to do things that I haven’t ever done before is healthy for me. It’s how I choose to break out of my default setting, which is why I think going to Asia will be so rejuvenating for me.
