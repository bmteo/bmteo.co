								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p class="box">I would like to begin this paper by openly stating that I do not believe that the career value I received at Sauder was equal to the value that I paid to attend the school. Let me clarify: I take all of the blame for my experience with the school. This paper serves as an exploratory tool, in order to look inward on my time at Sauder, and to identify ways in which I can put myself in a position to succeed.
								</p>

								<h3>University</h3>
								<p class="box">I transferred to The University of British Columbia (UBC) in my second year of university, in the fall of 2014. Prior to attending UBC, I attended Boston College (BC), in Boston, Massachusetts, for my freshman year. It had been a long-held dream of mine to attend BC; I had identified it as my university of choice when I was just a sophomore in high-school. Because BC was a private liberal arts university, class sizes were small; there were between 15-30 students in each class. The high-school that I had attended had similarly sized classes as well. As such, I was accustomed to learning in intimate classroom settings, as well as having personal relationships with my teachers. As one may have easily predicted, my experience at UBC, a public research university, was the complete opposite of my experience at BC. The complete 180-degree change of learning environment was a shock to me, and it was an experience that I did not know how to handle.
								</p>
								<p class="box">Looking back on my time at UBC, I should have made a better effort in getting engaged. My biggest regret is knowing that I needed engagement in order to perform well in school, and life, and then choosing to not do anything about it. There were many semesters that flew by in the blink of an eye, not because I was doing a lot of things, but because I was sleepwalking through life. The lack of engagement that I had with my professors, with my colleagues, and the overall student body, had put me into an apathetic, almost catatonic state of mind. And so regardless of any specific instances where my environment had a part to play in why I was in such a state, I should have made a better effort in engaging myself with the school. Instead, I got lucky, and in the summer of 2017, a lifeline was extended to me, in the form of an internship with Amazon.
								</p>

								<h3>The Internship</h3>
								<p class="box">In the years leading up to my internship with Amazon, my academic performance was below the standard that I had set for myself in high-school. The confidence that I had in my abilities was waning, but it was around the time before my internship began, that I decided to engage myself. It is probably easier to say that the job itself called for engagement; the team comprised of myself and six other engineers, meaning that there was no room for apathy. Throughout the three month internship, I worked on a project that was designed specifically for me. The project required me to liaise with my mentor, manager, and other members of the team, as it was a critical part of the future plans for a larger system. It was during this time that I found myself re-energized, and by the end of the internship, I had regained my enthusiasm for actively engaging with other people. Following the conclusion of the internship, I received an offer to return to the company as an engineer. I attribute the success of the internship, and the consequent return offer, to the relationships that I created with my co-workers, and manager. Without choosing to engage myself with the rest of the team, I am confident that I would not have been as successful.
								</p>
								<p class="box">It is necessary to acknowledge that the internship does not justify my lack of action during my four years at UBC; I could have accomplished so much more in that time. With this acknowledgement in mind, there are two takeaways that are useful in formulating a five year plan. </p>
								<p>
									<ul class="list-group">
										<li class="list-group-item"><b>Always make an effort to get engaged. </b>This is blindingly obvious, but because engagement is the special ingredient to my success, both academically, and in my career, it is something that I need to constantly remind myself. My personality borders on the edge of being an introvert, and so I have a natural tendency to reclude myself if I am not reminding myself to get engaged. </li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><b>Identify bad environments, and remove myself from them.</b> Many people, myself included, accept bad environments, and abdicate the responsibility of putting ourselves in the position to succeed. I spent a lot of time blaming the school for my experience with it, but I never once looked inward and identified the changes that I needed to make, in order to succeed in my career. </li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h3>The Five Year Plan</h3>
								<p class="box">My big, lofty, ambitious goal, is to work for a startup company in Silicon Valley, as a team manager, who works on a product that has a large social utility. In order to accomplish this, I have set some distal goals (Table 1), that will be instrumental in getting to my desired destination. In the meantime, I have also set some proximal goals (Table 2), that will continue the momentum that I currently have, until I begin work at Amazon in the fall.
								</p>
								<p class="box">Engaging in relationships, whether they be professional or personal, are the bedrock of my success. Throughout high-school and my first year of university in Boston, it was the relationship that I had with my professors and teachers that energized me to work hard. For this reason, my biggest goal for the coming months is to search for a career mentor. I hope to engage with this mentor, in order to glean insight into other aspects of my career that I may have overlooked.
								</p>
								<p class="box">Darrell always asks us to reflect on where we want to be in our career, in five or ten years. If he had asked me that years ago, I would not have been able to give him an answer. I now know what it takes for me to be successful in my career, and personal life. I need engagement, autonomy, and work that I find meaningful. I learned that I need to be active in trying to pursue these goals that I set for myself; my career will not fall into my lap. </p>
								<p class="box">A friend once told me that you need to be lucky to be good, and good to be lucky. After wasting four years of university, I now refuse to squander the luck that I have encountered in my career. By goal-setting, and being mindful of what motivates me, I am confident that I can accomplish my lofty, ambitious goal. There will not be anymore sleepwalking in my life.
